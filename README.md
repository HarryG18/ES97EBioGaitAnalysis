# ES97EBioGaitAnalysis
Code repository for Gait Analysis graphs

The workspace file contains all the necessary variables and datasets pre-assigned, and the matlab file will not work without them.

To run the program, put both files into a folder, launch MATLAB, import the workspace file then run the dataprocessing file.
The graphs will be shown in various figures that can be resized. Note some graphs anotations such as lettering A-F and descriptions of +ve and -ve y axis space were done post figure generation manually.
